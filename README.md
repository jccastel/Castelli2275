# Castelli2275
CSCI 2275 Final Project

Project Summary
This project will use a graph data structure to create basic simulation of a mobile wireless network. The purpose of the graph is to model simple network parameters in order to elect the best path to transmit data through the network. Vertices will be individual radios. Edges will connect radios that have a positive signal to noise ratio (SNR). SNR weight will be used to determine the best path for data to pass through the network. However, the weighting may be non-linear as a hop through one radio to get to another beyond it will incur a penalty, as opposed to a direct connection.
